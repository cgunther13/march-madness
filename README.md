# march-madness
Python program to fill out 20 years of historical March Madness brackets according to user selected criteria. Exported results to a user-friendly Excel dashboard showing which stats best predict "March Madness pool" points. Used to inform future bracket selections (hint: pick the team that shoots the most!).

run.py contains the body of the code. Employs OOP and relies on classes built in the classes folder, as well as historical basketball reference data in the data folder.
